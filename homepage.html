In early 2015 he signed with multinational label Warner Music and, months later, released his second promotional single "Bajo el agua," which accumulated more than 75,000,000 views on YouTube and was well received in Colombia and Mexico.

In the year 2016 he won two Latin Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Songwriting Album.

Manuel Medrano composes romantic music that he calls pop-cast, because it doesn't come from a specific genre, but from various influences of Latin American singer-songwriters.</p>
